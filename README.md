- 👋 Hi, I’m Prayash Thapa (@ashthapa0801)
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning and A.I as well as Signals and Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MSc Applied Machine Learning at Imperial College London. Alongside my studies, I am also working on 2 personal project of mine:
-         1. Shor's quantum factoring algorithm for conventional computers using MATLAB (continued undergrad project) 
-         2. Algorithmic trading bot using c++ (I am a newbie in this area)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a algorithmic trading bot and potentially applying 
-     machine learning as the project progresses
